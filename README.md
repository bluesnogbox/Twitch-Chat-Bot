Twitch IRC Python chat bot

A bot coded by myself and lclc98. We used an existing bot made by Liquid here: https://www.sevadus.tv/forums/index.php?/topic/774-simple-python-irc-bot/

The python version needed to run this is ver. 2.7.6 | If you wish to have the bot running in your channel without having to host it yourself. Head over to my channel or send me a message.

Any contributions are welcomed, we are currently in need of two procedures:
1. A way to check if a user is mod to allow them to use certain commands.
2. A way to check if a user is a sub to allow them to use certain commands.
