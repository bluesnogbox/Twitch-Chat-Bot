Twitch IRC Python chat bot

A bot coded by myself and lclc98. We used an existing bot made by Liquid here: https://www.sevadus.tv/forums/index.php?/topic/774-simple-python-irc-bot/

The python version needed to run this is ver. 2.7.6 | If you wish to have the bot running in your channel without having to host it yourself. Head over to my channel or send me a message.

INSTALLATION:
There is none. Extract the files and run start.py

CONFIGURATION:
Open 'config.py' in your preffered text editor (Notepad will work fine) and edit the CHAN, NICK & PASS fields with the appropriate information (Channel you wish the bot to be in, Your Twitch username, Twitch OAuth code (See resources to get it)). Be sure to leave the quotey things (These things '') as they are required by python to be there.

RESOURCES:
Go here to get your OAuth code: http://twitchapps.com/tmi/
